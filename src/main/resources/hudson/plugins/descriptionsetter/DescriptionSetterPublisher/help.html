	This plugin automatically sets a description for the build after it has completed.

	<p>
	A description can be based on the log output (by searching it using a regular expression), or it can be hardcoded. If no regular expression is configured and the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin">Token Macro plugin</a> is installed macros specified in the description are expanded.
