	<p>
	This plugin automatically sets a description for the build after it has completed.
	</p>
	<p>
	A description can be based on the log output (by searching it using a regular expression), or it can be hardcoded.
	</p>
	<p>
	Optionally, the description is exposed as DESCRIPTION_SETTER_DESCRIPTION environment variable (considered insecure on Jenkins 2)
